    "## An Overview Of The Ronchi Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ronchi test is much like the Foucault test in its set-up. Unlike the Foucault test, however, the Ronchi test is not inherently quantitative. It cannot tell you exactly how good (or bad) you mirror actually is. It does easily show all the mirror's zones and irregularities. It can also give you a very good feeling for the overall quality of your mirror and can give you all that information at a glance. That is where the test really shines. You may use the test to get that clear, quick overview of the shape of your mirror as a whole. You would then normally want to run some other quantitative test against your mirror to determine whether you have met your desired quality criteria.\n",

    "\n",
    "To run the Ronchi test, you need a small pinhole or slit light source which illuminates the mirror under test and a knife edge carriage in the path of the returning light from the mirror. Both the light source and the carriage are placed near the radius of curvature of the mirror. In the Ronchi test, the actual knife edge is replaced by a fine grating consisting of opaque lines ruled onto a transparent substrate. The mirror's surface is viewed through this grating. As the carriage is moved slightly toward and away from the mirror, the lines on the grating which appear projected onto the surface of the mirror will change in response to the new configuration. For a spherical mirror, the lines will appear straight and undistorted. For any shape other than spherical, the lines will appear bent in an amount and direction dependent on the mirror diameter, its radius of curvature, its conic shape, the grating's line density, and the placement of the grating with respect to the radius of curvature point. Figure 2 below shows some typical Ronchi test images at several different grating offsets. \n",

    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been a movement towards making the Ronchi test more quantitative. The newer method of running the test has been termed the Matching Ronchi test. While it is still fundamentally qualitative, the Matching Ronchi test attempts to be able to apply some criteria to the testing so that the result is a bounding of the quality of the mirror. The new method of using the test does this by having the operator match the appearance of their mirror to a perfect mirror having exactly the same specifications as their own. When the two match, you are done. Finding or making such a comparison mirror would seem an impossible task. That is where the modern Personal Computer enters the scene. A computer is capable of creating just such a perfect mirror and showing the test operator what their mirror should look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Matching Ronchi test is easy to perform. You create a virtual, perfectly figured mirror with the same specifications as your own on the computer screen and then visually verify that your in-process mirror looks the same. Since the distortion of the bands depends on several factors, to ensure an actual match, you must compare your mirror and the virtual mirror at three or more different offsets. When the two match at all offsets you compare, then your mirror is done. Further, you can get some idea of how accurate your mirror is if you can also compare it to several virtual mirrors with a known amount of error. In this way, it is possible to assign an upper quantitative bound to the accuracy of your mirror using a qualitative test. This is the basis for the Matching Ronchi test. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only task that remains is to write a computer program that can simulate the appearance of a perfect mirror undergoing the Ronchi test. Taking this one step further, the program can also calculate the appearance of a mirror with a known amount of error. Two such virtual mirrors can then be used to set the bounds the user works within to achieve their desired quality criteria. These are the key tasks performed inside the Freeware program Ronchi for Windows."

    "## The Geometry of the Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental task of simulating the distortion of the grating's lines in the Ronchi test can be approached from simple geometry. In the discussion that follows, I will freely (and sloppily) use the absolute value of many of the quantities in order to keep the steps clear and concise. If you wish to write a program based on this information, you must pay close attention to sign conventions. (The computer is much less forgiving than the human mind in this respect.) Figure 3 below shows two views of the Ronchi test. The view at the left represents the view the user has while performing the Ronchi test. The view is from the perspective of the tester looking at the face of the mirror. The right view is a plan view from the top looking down on the test set-up. \n",

    "Imagine a ray of light leaving the tester's source at the radius of curvature and hitting the mirror. If the mirror is spherical, that ray will return to the light source. In practice, the light source may be moved slightly away from the optical axis so that the returning ray may be viewed. Most ATMs may prefer to move the source down a small amount and view the returning light over the top of the source. This makes it easily visible and avoids some of the effects of moving the source to one side. For the purposes of simulation, however, it will be assumed that everything is precisely on axis. In addition, the simulation will assume that the light source and grating move as a unit. This is the so called moving source tester design. A fixed source (but moving grating) tester may be approximated by halving the grating offsets input for the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the left view in Figure 3, assume that a light ray hits the mirror at point $P$. Assuming the origin is at the center of the mirror, that ray has an $x$ offset of $P_x$, a $y$ offset of $P_y$, and hits the mirror at a zonal radius of $P_r$. By definition, the radius of curvature of the central zone of the mirror is $R$. Any ray that hits the mirror at a zonal radius $P_r$ from the center of the mirror will cross the optical axis at a point $b \\cdot s$ away from $R$, where $b$ is the\n",

    "Next, we need to consider the grating which is placed a short distance from the radius of curvature of the mirror. We will call this distance $o$ for offset. To complete the definition of quantities, let $g$ represent the line width of the grating. This is the width of a single opaque line in the grating. We will define the edge length as the width of the individual lines and gaps of the grating. \n",

    "## Making The Ideal Image More Realistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The above method calculates the ideal appearance of the Ronchi grating's shadow bands across the face of the mirror. We have assumed a point source and ignored the effects of diffraction. Both of these factors affect the true appearance of a mirror under the Ronchi test. If it is desirable to have a somewhat more realistic appearance to the simulation, further processing of the Ronchi images may be done. (Of course one could also use wave optics theory rather than geometry to generate the image. In that case, no further processing would be required.) \n",
    "\n",
    "There are (at least) three similar methods for processing the image to give a more realistic appearance. Each is just a way of defocussing the image and optionally applying some artistic license to model diffraction effects. The first method is to assume a finite width slit and calculate each mirror point as many times as required to model the width of the slit. Each of these intermediate calculations is added together to get the resultant intensity color of the image at that point. The second method also assumes a finite width slit and then assumes that the mirror's image from each sliver of the slit is just added together. In this method the image is calculated once per the above standard method and then added to an offset version of itself a number of times simulating the addition of multiple slit image increments. \n",

    "Each of these methods has drawbacks in coding, so Ronchi for Windows uses an approach used in more traditional image processing applications. This is the third method. It consists of processing each pixel in the ideal Ronchi image using a modified blur filter. The blur filter is modified from its usual form to help account for diffraction effects in the image. While not an accurate representation of diffraction, it results in an image which at least reminds the user somewhat of how diffraction effects appear in the Ronchi test. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the blur filter is changed as screen resolution changes, but its general form remains the same. It can be represented by the matrix shown at upper left. This differs from the traditional blur filter primarily in that it is not symmetrical. The filter is a bit wider in the x direction than it is in the y direction. This tends to blur the image more across its diameter than in its height. While it is not very asymmetrical, its effects are visible on the screen and it gives a more pleasing appearance to the resulting image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The absolute size of the matrix is determined by the current screen image size. By keeping the matrix size a certain percentage of screen resolution, the image blurring appears natural regardless of size. (You probably would not want to apply a 10 by 10 blur filter to an image only 50 pixels wide.) In use, the filter is applied to each point in the ideal image by using the matrix to multiply each pixel by its neighbors, sum, and then normalize the point. Attention must be paid to boundary conditions during the application of the blur filter. After applying the filter to every point in the ideal image, the result is then displayed as the \"realistic\" Ronchi image for the user. "
